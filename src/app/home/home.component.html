            <h3>Tour guide service</h3>
            <p>A tour guide will travel and accompany the guests throughout the tour. A tour guide in India must have a valid guiding license from the Government of India, where they have to compete an exam and undergo 6 months theoretical and practical training.</p>
            <p>An accompanying tour guide or escort will assist you with check-in / check-out at the hotels, as well as guide you through and explain the history of monuments, places, culture, traditions and customs of the Indian people. A tour guide will be at your disposal throughout the tour.</p>
            <p>The tour guide’s fee will always include costs for their accommodation and food.</p>

            <span class="p-gold"><p>All our tour guides have valid licenses issued by the Government of India.</p></span>

            <p>A private driver is not your tour guide, as they are not allowed to enter monuments and show you around. A tour driver’s primary job is to drive you safely and smoothly from one place to another.</p>
<p>They can of course take you to good restaurants, nice places, and up to the monument ticket window, as well as give you relevant information about your tour.</p>
<p>Your driver will wait until you finish the visit of any particular monument, and will take care of your luggage and belongings.</p>
<p>A cost for the car, their food and accommodation will always be included in the driver’s fee.</p>

<p>All our drivers speak conversational English so there are no communication issues.</p>
